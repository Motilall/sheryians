.elm#elm$*3 -> this will print 3 elm with proper id

display flex divide the elemnts in rows and coloumns but there is a catch
display flex is a single dimension property
it can only work in only in one direction
flex direction is in rows
we can change it to coloumns


in display grid we can control both row and coulumn at the same time
after applying display grid to the parent elemnet it will automatically adjust the elments on it's own


on child justify-self works
