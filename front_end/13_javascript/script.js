// js is a language
// it is managed by ecmascript(community), they bring new features, fix the bugs

// in js we mainly learn how to write the code and in js dom we learn how to use them
// js is maninly of two parts es5(var) and es6(let)

//interpreter converts fast english to machine code

//jit compiler (just in time) - takes the power of interpreter to convert code in machine language and takes the power of compiler to run the code

// data types are of two types primitive and reference data type
// reference data types are - [] {} ()
// apart from these brackets everything is primitive data types

// in primitve types the real value is copied 
// a = 12;
// b = a;
// b = b + 2;
// the value of b is 14 and the value of a is 12 because it is the real copy

// in reference types the reference value is copied
// arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6];
// brr = arr;
// brr.pop();
// now the value of brr is [1,2,3,4,5]
// and the vlaue of arr is [1,2,3,4,5]
// this is problematic because it is taking the value of reference
// brr is nothing just the arr
