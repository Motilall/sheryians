units = px % vw vh em rem

1px = 1pixel on the screen
we can replace px with vw

% -> it will take wiht respect to screen(screen is 100%)
when i change the screen the element will take size respect to screen % ration ( when i change the screen my element will also change)


% will take value from it's parent 
but
the vh and vw will take value with respective to it's screen


em depends on the elemets fron size and if we give this value to parent then it's child will also get affected
em = 16px 
if the font-size increases then the em will increase and if the font-size decrease then the em will decrease


rem = is root element
1rem = 16px

rem is for complete html and em will take value with respect to the parent element


max-width -> is the value from which you can not go further
min-width -> is the value from wich you can not go below
